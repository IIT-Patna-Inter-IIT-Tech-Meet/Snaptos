## Notations

- **Gas Estimation:** Our sophisticated algorithm analyzes the current network conditions to provide accurate gas estimates, ensuring optimal transaction execution.

- **Real-time APT to USD Conversion:** The conversion rates are sourced from reputable APIs, offering users a reliable and up-to-date valuation of their Aptos holdings.

- **On-chain Account Creation:** Behind the scenes, Aptos Wallet leverages smart contract interactions to securely and efficiently create Aptos accounts directly on-chain.

- **Advanced APT to USD prediction model:** The forecasting engine is built using a Bidirectional LSTM model, which is trained on historical data to predict future Aptos price movements. We have trained the model on more than 500 continuous data points which we scraped ourselves from the internet through multiple sources/price feeds. The various model hyperparameters are:

  - **Number of LSTM layers:** 1
  - **Optimizer:** Adam
  - **Loss function:** Mean Squared Error
  - **Number of epochs:** 100
  - **Batch size:** 9
  - **Learning rate:** 0.001
  - **Lookback period:** 16 time units

## Architecture

## Why LSTM?
- Given the highly volatile nature of the crypto market, we need a model that can capture the non-linearities and complexities of the data. Simple statistical algorithms like ARIMA and SARIMA are not suitable for this task as they are not able to capture the non-linearities and complexities of the data. CNNs, RNNs and their variations have proved to be very effective in forecasting complex time series data. We have used LSTM as it is a very powerful variation of RNNs and is able to capture long term dependencies in the data. We have used a Bidirectional LSTM as it is able to capture the dependencies in both the directions of the time series data.
- Although RNNs and CNNs were meant for time series data, they usually falter at remembering long term dependencies in the data. LSTMs and GRUs were made to overcome this limitation and thus here we have used LSTMs, which are a superior version of RNNs.
